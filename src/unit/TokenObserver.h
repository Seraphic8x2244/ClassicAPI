// observer set for `guid`, dispatching to `cb` on each watched field change.
// Mirrors the engine's own `FUN_0051bbb0` / `FUN_0051bdb0` (identical field
// set + per-field watched sizes), so `cb` fires for exactly the fields the
// engine treats as token-scoped unit events (`UNIT_HEALTH`, `UNIT_MANA`,
// `UNIT_AURA`, `UNIT_LEVEL`, …).
//
// This makes a synthetic token (focus, nameplateN) a first-class unit-event
// source: the engine only registers these observers for its own tokens
// (target/party/raid/pet/mouseover via the `unit+0xc90` watch mask), so a
// focused mob that isn't otherwise one of them fires no unit events until we
// watch it ourselves. The registrar appends a fresh node per (guid, field)
// with no dedup, so our observer coexists with the engine's — a unit that is
// simultaneously the target keeps firing `"target"` while ours fires its own
// token. Unregister is a safe no-op once the object is gone (the engine frees
// observer nodes with the object).
//
// `cb` runs inside SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT dispatch; firing engine events from it
// is sanctioned (the engine's own callback `FUN_0051bd50` does exactly that).
