// Cached stats for a party/raid member, read from the group roster
// (fed by SMSG_PARTY_MEMBER_STATS). This is the ONLY source for a member with
// no live CGUnit — a groupmate on a different map or otherwise out of range —
// and is exactly what the engine's UnitHealth / UnitMana fall back to. Any
// module that reads unit fields off the descriptor should consult this when
// the descriptor is unavailable so it doesn't report 0 for out-of-range
// groupmates.
//
// `full` distinguishes the two backing structures: the party stats block and
// the raid slot. Both carry health / power / level / area / online; `dead`,
// `subgroup`, and `rank` come only from the raid slot (0 / false on the party
// path). Power values are RAW (divide by the power divisor for display);
// health is the roster u16, matching what UnitHealth returns out of range.

// Pure — no Lua, no throw; safe from any context.
