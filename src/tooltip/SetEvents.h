// Tooltip::Compare building the equipped item into a shopping tooltip. Without
// it, a handler would run in the middle of our line-shift / delta rendering and
// see a half-built tooltip. Only the item builder runs during that internal
// build, so in practice this gates OnTooltipSetItem; it's global for safety.
